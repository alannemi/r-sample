This code was used as part of my Capstone project (GV343) at LSE, where our team leveraged V-Dem data to visualize the qualities of democracy in our three case studies (Venezuela, Cambodia, and Zimbabwe). This informed subsequent research and policy recommendations in the final report produced for the report's client - the National Democratic Institute (NDI).
