# r-sample

The first code (v-dem-code) was used as part of my Capstone project (GV343) at LSE, where our team leveraged V-Dem data to visualize the qualities of democracy in our three case studies (Venezuela, Cambodia, and Zimbabwe). This informed subsequent research and policy recommendations in the final report produced for the report's client - the National Democratic Institute (NDI).

The second code (GV249-code) was submitted as part of the summative coursework required for GV249: Research Design in Political Science, to demonstrate my abilities in basic data manipulation and visualizing linear regressions. On this summative, I received an overall mark of 88/100 (a high first-class mark), with a near-perfect score in Part III (which included the code).
