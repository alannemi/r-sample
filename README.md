This code was used as part of my Capstone project (GV343) at LSE, where our team leveraged V-Dem data to visualize the qualities of democracy in our three case studies (Venezuela, Cambodia, and Zimbabwe). This informed our research and policy recommendation in our final report produced for our client - the National Democratic Institute (NDI).
